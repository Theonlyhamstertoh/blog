Hi! I'm Weibo! I'm a current college student passionate in technology and building things. I am in the process of exploring myself and finding my so-and-so purpose. I'm a lover of music, self-improvement books, cats, and traveling.

My hopes for this blog is to share a little of my current journey in my life. I don't know what my future holds. I don't know if what I'm doing now is the right thing. I don't know. I am not sure.

But that's life isn't it? To have a little faith that I will end up well even if I cannot see it now : )

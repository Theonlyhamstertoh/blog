## Travel

Planning week trips for November & December as I do love traveling.

## Blogging & Writing

Writing has always been very important to me and I want to start developing my voice here. My goal is to write twice a week, long or short.

## Working on [Bluon AI](https://www.bluon.ai)

Since there was an sudden surge in users, I want to continue developing it in the ways below:

- Fine-tuning AI model with 50,000 transcripts
- Allowing part search and identification through BluonSearch
- Inplementing conversational context

## Reading More Great Books

I love reading books. My goal now is to read an hour each night before I sleep and write blogs bi-monthly on it.

## Fun & Social

There won't be as much joy and excitement to do the things above if I didn't have some fun ; ) I want to prioritize my social bucket, prioritize friendships and relationships, dancing, going out with friends, and trying a new experience every week
